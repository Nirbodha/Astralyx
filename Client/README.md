# Client
Astralyx is supposed to be a game playable on the browser. However, I didn't account for the fact that I'm an absolute idiot. Websockets and the like are infuriating, so I'm just going to push it away for now. Until then, I'll just create  a downloadable client, probably in Go. Or Java. Whatever.
